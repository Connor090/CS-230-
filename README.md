Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

Client was the Gaming Room, they wanted to develop software for a game called draw it or lose it. The game currently existed on android, but the owner 
wanted the game to be useable on multiple platforms. The software had to be capable of scaling, function on multiple platforms, and utilize unique ID's.




What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

Correctly adressing client requests and design constraints are in my option the most important parts of a design documentation. I believe I addressed these
correctly and was pleased in the final document.




What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The constraints and requirements for potential future expansion allowed for me to consider that serverless cloud was the correct choice for this project.




If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

In future with more experience I would revisit the evaluation page to consider strengths and weaknesses when I have more actual experience using those platforms. Untill that time, I am basically just regurgitating what I have read, without any actual experience.



How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? 

The demands were faily straight forward. Normally at a certain stage the product owner would take requests from the development team and relay these to the stakeholder to develop clarification on specifics or requests. As the person paying for the product, the users needs are of the upmost importance when developing.





How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

Starting simple. I prefer to work with a barebones approach and then build off of that. Throughout the developent process its highly likely that many things will be changed, either via design or timeline constraints, or changes in requests from the stakeholders. Its important to try and remain adaptable.
